            <h1>Personal Bio</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Michael Paschal and I am a Senior at Liberty University. 
                I am set to graduate in May 2023 with a Bachelor of Science: Information Technology- Web and Mobile Programming.
                After graduation I plan to begin studying for my Master of Science in Information Technology- Network Design and Security, 
                which I have been accepted to begin at Liberty University Summer 2023. I hope to find work as a network security engineer.
                I have a supportive wife of five years and a joyful young three year-old daughter.
